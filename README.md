🌟 Sometimes a small spark can turn recovery time into a learning journey.
I’d been down with a fever recently and wasn’t feeling well. But instead of just resting, an idea popped into my mind:
“Why not build something simple and fun with a local LLM?”
So I did.
 I built a tiny AI Math Solver using:
 ✅ Gradio for an instant, shareable UI
 ✅ Ollama + Gemma3 to run the language model locally
 ✅ Python, my favorite problem-solving tool
🤖 What it does
It’s simple but powerful:
You type any math question — from equations to word problems.
Gemma3 explains the solution step by step.
Gradio makes it accessible for anyone to try in the browser — no setup, no extra tools.
💡 What I learned
Even while sick, I learned:
How easy it is to run Gemma3 locally with Ollama
How smooth Gradio makes sharing small AI tools
That you can turn an idea into something useful in under 20 lines of Python
✨ Sometimes you don’t need a big plan — just a spark of curiosity.
